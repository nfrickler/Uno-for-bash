This is uno_v2.1

Usage:
 - uno_server.pl [host] [port] [players]
		* [host]:	Name of host to listen on (default: localhost)
		* [port]:	Port to listen on (default: 4321)
		* [players]:Number of players (default: unlimited; you will have to
					start the game sending "start")

 - UNO_CLIENT.pl [host] [port] [name]
		* [host]:	Name of host to connect to
		* [port]:	Port on host to connect to
		* [name]:	Your name
		** All parameters for the client are optional, if no parameter is
			given, you will find a form to enter these things.

 Start one server and [players] clients connecting to this server
 to start the game. Moreover, the admin player (the one who connects
 first) can start the game sending "start".
 You can lay cards according to uno-rules by entering the current number
 of your card.
 Don't forget to say "uno" when laying the card next to last.

 To chat with other players, just start you input with "#".

 The current player is marked with an "u" or and "d" in the players list.
 Those two letters show you the direction of the current game:
 "u" means "up" and "d" means "down".
If a player exists during the game, the game will go on without him.

 The rest at least should be obvious ;-)

Enjoy!

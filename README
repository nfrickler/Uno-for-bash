This is uno_for_bash_v2.2

Usage:
 - uno_server.pl [host] [port] [players]
		* [host]:	Name of host to listen on (optional; default: localhost)
		* [port]:	Port to listen on (optional; default: 4321)
		* [players]:Number of players (optional; default: no limit; first player
					or server-admin has to enter "start" to start the game)

 - UNO_CLIENT.pl [host] [port] [name]
		* [host]:	Name of host to connect to
		* [port]:	Port on host to connect to
		* [name]:	Your name
		** All parameters for the client are optional, if no parameter is
			given, you will find a form to enter these things.

Start one server (using your ip and some port-number) and share these
connection details with all players, so they can start a client with
this connection-data.

To start the game, either hit the player-limit (set for the server)
or enter "start" in the server-console. Moreover, the admin-player
(the one, who connected first) can enter "start" as well.

Once the game is started you will be prompted a message "What card?", if
it is your turn.
Either lay an appropriate card, according to uno-rules or enter "d" to draw
a new card. If you have already drawn at least one card, you can
enter "p" to pass on to next player, if you cannot lay any card.
Don't forget to say "uno" when laying the card next to last.

To chat with other players, just start you input with "#".

The current player is marked with an "u" or and "d" in the players list.
The two letters show you the direction of the current game:
"u" means "up" and "d" means "down".
If a player exists during the game, the game will go on without him.

The rest at least should be obvious ;-)

Enjoy!
